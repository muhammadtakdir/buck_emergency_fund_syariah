# 🚨 BUCK Emergency Fund (Sharia-Compliant DeFi)
**Instant BUCK liquidity for Bottle holders, powered by a decentralized Waqf & Ujrah system on Sui.**

---

## 📖 Overview
**BUCK Emergency Fund** is a decentralized, Sharia-compliant lending protocol on the Sui blockchain. It provides instant **BUCK** liquidity to users who lock **SUI** as collateral. 

Designed with ethical finance in mind, the protocol replaces traditional interest (Riba) with a sustainable model of **Service Fees (Ujrah)** and a **System-Owned Endowment (Waqf)**. 

### 💎 Yield Layering for Partners
Lenders (Partners) earn rewards from two sources:
1.  **Platform Fees:** 40% of all service fees collected from borrowers.
2.  **Bucket Yield:** All idle BUCK in the protocol is automatically staked into the **Bucket Protocol Saving Pool**, earning automated SUI rewards for partners.
